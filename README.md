# Nazarick Movies
A movie portal project in development, using PHP and Javascript!

- It uses AJAX to fetch stuff from themoviedb's API.
- Presents movies' information on the landing page.
- Has a search function that sends the query by Ajax requisition.
- Is more or less responsive for mobile through CSS media queries.
  
Initially developed for a project from course on PUC Minas (the HTML and JS part), and then I decided to use it to practice PHP.
Which means PHP parts are still in development (and so am I, since I'm using this for practice!)
