# Nazarick Movies
A movie portal project in development, using PHP and Javascript!
To see the working front-end with themoviedb's API <a href='https://sitediwt2.undefmoonface.repl.co/'>click here(Repl.it)</a>!

- It uses AJAX to fetch stuff from themoviedb's API.
- Presents movies' information on the landing page.
- Has a search function that sends the query by Ajax requisition.
- Is more or less responsive for mobile through CSS media queries.
- Since the front-end was already completed back in 2020, the PHP back-end is mostly incomplete for now.
- I plan to code a simple PHP backend for it without using frameworks for this project specifically.

Aside from that it uses the following libraries & components:
- Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- jQuery (https://jquery.com/)
- PHP League Plates component (https://packagist.org/packages/league/plates)
  
Initially developed for a project from course on PUC Minas (the HTML and JS part), and then I decided to use it to practice PHP.
Which means PHP parts are still in development (and not optimal, since I'm using this for practice!)
